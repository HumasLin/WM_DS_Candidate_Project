Hi!

This is Haomin Lin, here I include my solution to the DS Candidate Project from WarnerMedia. This is a very interesting project, and I enjoyed it very much! Thank you for preparing it for me!

There are two Jupyter notebooks covering different part of the project. The first one `WM_project_EDA.ipynb`includes the Exploratory Data Analysis on the data, where I investigate how the data are distributed and also include some sanity check.

The second notebook `WM_project_modeling.ipynb` is mostly about predictive modeling, where I used different data pre-processing and implemeneted tree-based ensemble models in Machine Learning to make the prediction. After that, I used the best model to make prediction so that the dataset can be expanded. And I did some analysis based on the results.

Thank you so much! Please let me know if you have any questions :)

All the best,

Haomin
